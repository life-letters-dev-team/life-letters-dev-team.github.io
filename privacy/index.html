<p>
    This Privacy Statement explains in general terms how Life Letters Pty Ltd (Life Letters) protects the privacy of your personal information under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), including the National Privacy Principles. It will apply to any personal information you provide to us in the course of your dealings with us.
</p>

<h2>Information collected and used</h2>
<p>
    The types of personal information that we collect from you will depend on the circumstances of collection and its relevance to the purposes of collection.
</p>
<p>
    For example, we may request your personal information (such as name, phone, address, gender, interests etc.) via our website, in a store, over the telephone etc in order to provide product information, marketing materials, provide newsletters, electronic newsletters (e-newsletters), provide new release / launch information, and advise our products, competitions or events, which may be of interest. No one is obligated to provide their personal information. However, failure to do so may result in us being unable to provide you with upcoming promotion, event or product information and/or provide certain services including sales of products and after sales services. If you do not want to receive information about our products, competitions or events, please let us know by contacting our Privacy Officer through the details below.
</p>
<p>
    If you are interested in franchise opportunities, we may collect your personal details and information about you to help us assess you as a potential franchisee.
</p>
<p>
    As we are required by law to obtain your consent to the collection of “sensitive information” we will assume that you have consented to the collection of all information which is provided to us for use in accordance with this Statement, unless you tell us otherwise.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
    A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree (or your browser agrees automatically if you have set it up in that way), your browser adds that text in a small file.
</p>
<p>
    We may use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to user needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is de-identified or removed from the system. Denial of a traffic log cookie may prevent you from using our website.
</p>

<h2>
    Disclosure of personal information to third parties
</h2>
<p>
    We will only disclose your personal information to a third party where we have your consent, or where the disclosure is permitted or required by law. For example, we may disclose your personal information to:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Life Letters’s related companies and Life Letters franchisees</li>
 <li>third parties that provide services to Life Letters such as filling orders, technical support, legal or financial advice or assisting with promotions, or</li>
 <li>government, regulatory and law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Life Letters does not sell personal information to third parties. However, with your permission, we will, on occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. You may be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from our business partners. If you elect to receive such materials, Life Letters will not share your personal information with these partners but rather will send a mailing or e-mail on behalf of those partners.
</p>

<h2>
    Access to and correction of information we hold about you
</h2>
<p>
    We will, on request, provide you with access to the information we hold about you, including for the purpose of correcting or updating that information.  However, in some cases, we need not provide that access (for example, we need not provide access where to do so would pose a serious threat to the health of another person, or unreasonably impact another person’s privacy).
</p>
<p>
    We may recover from you our reasonable costs of supplying you with access to this information.
</p>
<p>
    Your request to provide access to this information will be dealt with in a reasonable time.  If we refuse to provide you with access to the information, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and inform you of any exceptions relied upon under the National Privacy Principles.
</p>

<h2>
    Keeping your personal information up-to-date
</h2>
<p>
    We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date whenever we collect or use it.
</p>
<p>
    If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date please contact us and we will take reasonable steps to either correct this information, or if necessary, discuss alternative action with you.
</p>

<h2>
    Transfer of information overseas
</h2>
<p>
    We may transfer to people in foreign countries any of your personal information to fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, for example, to our offices overseas, or to data processors.  All such transfers are on the basis that the information will be kept confidential, and not used except for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
</p>
