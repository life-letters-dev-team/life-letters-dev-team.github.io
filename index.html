                    We are all made of the same stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different kinds of cells that build our physical form.<br>
                    But at the heart of every cell is our DNA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our DNA makes us who we are. It defines what makes us different.

                <p>
                    They combine to inform us of our ancestry,<br>
                    to define our physical traits, our response to drugs<br>
                    and our risk of disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are our life letters.

                <p>
                    When we know our own life letters, we know<br>
                    ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can take control of our medical treatment.<br>
                    And arm the professionals we trust with the<br>
                    information they need to look after us better.
