<h1>Community Manager</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Join a passionate and driven team looking to revolutionize health care</li>
    <li>Once in a lifetime opportunity for a social media expert who thrives on challenge and wants to build a movement</li>
    <li>Foster your intellectual curiosity, growth and development</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This newly created role will represent Life Letters’ “voice” across multiple social and community platforms and channels.
</p>
<p>
    We’d like you to be curious, and ideally a little knowledgeable about genetics (it’s what we do), but we’d love to share that world with you if you can bring passion and extraordinary skill in community building to the table. 
</p>
<p>
    With the launch of two innovative genomics products in the coming months, we want to be thought leaders in this exciting field and our social media and community presence is a vital part of that.
</p>
<p>
    You will initially build category awareness among doctors and consumers. The main objectives will be to generate that awareness, identify “champions” ,  foster the conversation around genomic health and personalised medicine and build SEO authority. 
</p>
<p>
    Some of this conversation will be controversial. We don’t she away from that. We want to be an authentic and honest voice and a platform for debate. Hence, an exciting challenge for this role will be the creation of a high profile social media presence in an area that is poorly understood by the general public and, at times, elicits emotionally charged responses. 
</p>
<p>
    Closer to launch, the role will focus on brand messaging and, ultimately, product messaging, though always promoting Life Letters as a thought-leader and a category maker not just a service provider.
</p>
<p>
    The longer-term focus will include managing Life Letters’ social media presence both pre- and post-launch for each new product. 
</p>
<h2>Key Selection Criteria</h2>
<p>
Current understanding of genomics is not required.
</p>
<p>

    <li>Being open to feedback with good instincts on when to ask for help. </li>
    <li>A genuine desire for experimenting with ideas and being resourceful.</li>
    <li>Always taking a proactive approach with a strong eye for detail.</li>
